snow

idea: start drawing shit inside of sphere: circle or lines and a shit load with lerp components

intro with lines
first break: flat cube
then first beat = 3d cube 
second break  = other text
second beat just the circle in slow mo
and out


DOC:
i = sets intro to false and clears blocks array
e = toggles entracte
p = creates a world
o = sets outro to true, sets intro_pos to (0, 0, 0)
r = sets red rectangle background
g = sets green rect background
b = sets blue background background
d = less detail on the world
c = more detail on the world
SPACE= move vertex for cube

KONTROL NOTEON
first row of control is adding lines
second row is resetting leap
third is removing
41 = sets intro_pixels to true which means pixels
42 = toggles color mode
43 = toggles oscillation for spacing
44 = toggles oscillation for weight

KONTROL CONTROLLER CHANGE
if not outro:
faders:
0 = unify - sets spacing of lines
1 = unify
2 = unify
3 = map stroke weight
4 = map spacing of stroke
5 = map lerp increase for height
6 = map lerp increase for width
7 = map alpha
knobs:
8 = bg hue
9 = bg saturation
10 = bg brightness
11 = stroke weight coefficient
12 = spacing coefficient
13 = number of lines
14 = offset
15 = bpm

BEAT STEP NOTEON
44 = rotate cube x
45 = rotate cube y
46 = rotate cube z
47 = move up
48 = move vertex
49 = cube radI is reset to 0
36 = shows cubes
37 = move left
38 = move right
39 = move down
40 = move vertex
41 = cube rad0 set to max
